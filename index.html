      <p class="about-text">
        Naruto is a japanese anime that follows the tale of a shinobi, or ninja in english, named Naruto Uzumaki.  Right after being born a demon fox, the nine-tails or Kyuubi, was sealed within him to save Konoha from destruction.  Naruto is despised by his village for the beast within him without even knowing this so he becomes a trouble maker while attending Ninja School.  However when his teacher, Iruka, finally acknowledges him Naruto begins his long journey to realize his dream of becomming Hokage, the leader of his village.  He gets paired with his rival, Sasuke, and his love interest, Sakura on Team 7 with Kakashi leading them to becomming full fledged ninja.  Naruto makes many friends along his long journey and has many heartbreaks and set-backs to work though.  This anime spans well over 500+ episodes in two different series and follows Naruto from when he was 9 or 10 until his teenage years.  It did so well they even created a follow-up series about his son, Boruto, but thats another story.
